# bunsen-images-archives
An archive of background images from previous BunsenLabs releases.

Desktop backgrounds will be installed in 
/usr/share/images/bunsen/wallpapers/<releasename>

Login backgrounds will be installed in
/usr/share/images/bunsen/login/

Grub backgrounds will be installed in
/boot/grub/images/bunsen/grub/

Debian alternatives for desktop-grub will be set up
in the standard location /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-grub.png.

Default images from the last release will be shipped by bunsen-images.

NOTE: login and grub background image files will be named after their release name, 
with an uppercase first letter eg Helium.png.
If an equivalent file is shipped by bunsen-images it will have a lowercase name.
This is to avoid filename clashes requiring Breaks & Replaces declarations 
in debian/control that would need updating with every BunsenLabs new release.
